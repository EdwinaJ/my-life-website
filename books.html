            <h2>Inkheart by Cornelia Funke</h2>
            <p>
                This book has been one of my favorite books since I was 7 years old which is surprising considering it is a 400 page book filled with so much detail that it is sometimes hard to keep track of what is going on. It entails all things that I love about the genre of Fantasy and I do no think I will ever get tired of reading this fairy tale-filled novel.

            <h2>The Chronicles of Nick</h2>

            <p>
                <i>The Chronicles of Nick</i> is by far the most interesting book series I have read in a long time. It has satirical elements throughout the stories and yet manages to keep a serious tone about the plot. These books always manage to make me laugh and have a great plot that is always intriguing to read.

            <h2>The Mortal Instruments</h2>
            <p>
                This is another book series that I really enjoyed reading because it has fantastical elements of demons and angels, nephilim, warlocks, and much, much more. There were romance triangles and fight scenes that were amazingly written out by the author, Cassandra Clare, who is my all-time favorite author. I would reccommend this series to anyone who asks about it!
