            <h2>My Best Friend</h2>
            <p>
                The story behind this picture that I drew is that I was super bored one summer day and remembered that I had a picture of my best friend's arm on my phone, for whatever strange reason. I thought it would be cool to try and replicate it again except as a drawing and it turned out a lot nicer than I thought it would. I ended up showing my best friend, Christian, what I drew and he absolutely loved it. I ended up letting him have the hard copy, but I have this picture of it as a keepsake.

            <h2>The Eye</h2>

            <p>
                I drew this picture over a year ago in the cafeteria of my high school. I was purposely busying myself so I would not have to talk to the kids at my table, not because I didn't necessarily like them, but because I thought they talked too much. It started off as a really simple drawing with no shading or even a solid foundation of an eye. Soon, it became something I admired greatly.

            <h2>My Heart</h2>
            <p>
                This is the last picture that I drew and it is by far my favorite. It holds a lot of meaning because there was a lot going on with me at the time that I drew this and it is clear that I put in a lot of work into this picture. I also used a new technique of shading so it looks a little different from all the rest of the pieces I have ever done. I just really enjoy looking at this drawing and I hope you do too.
