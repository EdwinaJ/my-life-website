            <h2>We Are Your Friends</h2>
            <p>
               <i>We Are Your Friends</i> has to be one of my favorite underrated movies because it involves two of my favorite things: Zac Efron and EDM. The plot follows a group of friends all trying to make their mark on the world, especially Cole, the character Efron plays, who is an aspiring DJ hoping to make it in the music business. Along the way to figuring out what life means to each of them, Cole and his friends hit a rough patch that completey changes each of their lives, but ultimately gives them enough courage to pursue their dreams completely.

            <h2>The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part Two</h2>
            <p>I really enjoy post-apocalyptic movies and the entire Hunger Games Trilogy embodies everything I could ever want. I loved the actors and actresses that portrayed each character, the plot was amazing, and I couldn't be happier with how this last film of the entire movie franchise pulled everything together.

            <h2>Mad Max: Fury Road</h2>
            <p><i>Mad Max:Fury Road</i> has to be one of the weirder movies that I really enjoyed. It seems all of the people in the movie are completely psychotic and downright terrifying, but I found that could not keep my eyes off the screen when I was watching it because there was so much action going on. It was basically one big game of manhunt with crazy people driving rickety cars that were jacked up to kill anything and anyone that got in the way of its destination. And I loved every second of it.
